I categorized the goals by eye so here is the list to help you understand:
Transition Goals: 1 , 4, 6, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18
Possession-based Goals: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 12, 14, 16, 19

The code is kinda sloppy but I figured the team I was informing about how Liverpool does score goals wouldn't mind ;) 
Thanks for your amazing channel btw!
